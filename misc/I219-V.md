# The ridiculous Intel I219-v Ethernet Adapter

*The ethernet controller that almost made my lose me sanity.*  

This story si about one of the 2 Ethernet Adapters on the main machine in my rack, the one I talked about [here](/index.md).  

Now this machine is cobbled together with parts from high-end Gaming rigs.  
It has an I7-6700K and a nice GIGABYTE GA-Z170X-Gaming 5, which possesses 2 Ethernet Ports.  
Specifically an `Intel(R) Ethernet Connection I219-V` and a `Killer E2200 Gigabit Ethernet Controller`.  

The `Intel(R) Ethernet Connection I219-V` is the one that interests us today.  

## The missing (Ethernet) link

After having installed Hyper-V Server 2019 on the machine I started installing the driver I need.  
This motherboard has a bunch of features I have no use for, but of course I want both Ethernet Adapters enabled, as well as USB3.0/3.1 etc.  
Installing the `Killer E2200` went without issue, even on Windows Server Core.  
But when I got to the `Intel I219-V` the installer claimed there was no Intel Ethernet adapter on the machine.  
WTF?  

Ok, that's certainly strange, but it'll take a lot more to stop me.  
When you got driver trouble, what's the first thing you do on Windows?  
You check the `Device Manager`.  
Seeing as how this is a Hyper-V Server instance, it doesn't \*have\* a device manager...  
But it has PowerShell!  
And modern PowerShell has the handy little `Get-PnpDevice` command.  
With some PowerShell magic we can easily list all devices that are in an error or unknown state:  

```Powershell
> Get-PnpDevice | Where-Object {$_.status -ne "ok"} | sort status | ft Status, Class, FriendlyName, InstanceId

Well shit. It's not there.  
Could it be that it's just not in a bad state?  

```Powershell
> Get-PnpDevice -FriendlyName *ethernet* | ft Status, Class, FriendlyName, InstanceId

Status  Class FriendlyName                                     InstanceId
------  ----- ------------                                     ----------
OK      Net   Killer E2200 Gigabit Ethernet Controller         PCI\VEN_1969&DEV_E091&SUBSYS_E0001458&REV_10\FF1EC432408D5CFF00
```

Nope, it's simply not there.  
That's a new one.  
Maybe somewhat naive of me to hope that it would show up.  
At this point I'm fearing the worst, something is wrong with the hardware or the UEFI system,  
so I decide to go look in the UEFI and check if it's showing up there at all.  

After about 20 minutes of looking around, this little gem of a setting catches my eye:  

![GIGABYTE what are you doing](/images/onboard_lan.png "Why would this be disabled by default???")

It was set to disabled. By default.  
I ask myself, why? Why is it disabled by default? Why does it affect only 1 of the 2 Ethernet Controllers?  
What where they smoking when they made this board?  
The board itself isn't bad by any stretch, but I've ran a couple of other oddities...  

### A Brief Intermezzo

Another fun incident with this board:  
the board does not try to auto-detect where you have a screen hooked up and display on that.  
Instead it has *a setting for what port to use as display output*.  
By default *it seems to pick the first GPU it finds.*  
I stress, the first *GPU* it finds.  

*But what if I don't have a GPU installed?*  
Then you're shit out of luck.  
I spent the first half hour after having built this system, thinking it was DOA.  
It was only after I stuck in an old, *OLD* gpu and hooked the screen up to it that I actually got the UEFI to display.  

Once in the configuration, I could change the setting to use it's *ONBOARD HDMI PORT*.  
WHY WOULD THIS BE THIS WAY?? WHY GIGABYTE??  
WHY NOT AUTO-DETECT CONNECTED SCREENS??  
WHY NOT USE THE ONBOARD HDMI BY DEFAULT??  

/rant

Back to `The ridiculous Intel I219-v Ethernet Adapter`.  

After having enabled the `Onboard LAN Controller`, it finally decided to show up in my device list:  

```Powershell
> Get-PnpDevice -FriendlyName *ethernet* | ft Status, Class, FriendlyName, InstanceId

Status   Class FriendlyName                                     InstanceId
------   ----- ------------                                     ----------
OK       Net   Killer E2200 Gigabit Ethernet Controller         PCI\VEN_1969&DEV_E091&SUBSYS_E0001458&REV_10\FF1EC432408D5CFF00
Unknown  Net   Ethernet Controller
```

Wait what? It has no InstanceId?  
Kinda weird, but at least it showed up.  

Feeling somewhat confident, I try the Intel Driver Installer again.  

Overconfidence, clearly, as it was still telling me there was no compatible device found on this machine.  
> Well that can't be good.  

After a quick google search, I find out I'm not the only fool who tried this.  
Turns out, Windows Server 2019 (and thus, Hyper-V Server 2019 by extension) is not an *officially* supported OS for the `Intel(R) Ethernet Connection I219-V`,
so they simply hardcoded the installer to not work on Windows Server.  

My jaw drops and NerdRage once more overcame me...  
Why Intel?? What where you thinking??  
Searching the web, it turns out, quite a couple of people who wanted to run home-labs on Intel NUCs ran in to the exact same problem.  

Unfortunately for me, most of these people where using the device manager to manually the instal the `Intel(R) Ethernet Connection I219-LM` driver,
which seemed to work fine for them.  
I had no such luck as I had no access to such fluffy things as a GUI.  

Instead I'll have to do this the hard way.  

## Safeties off

After scouring the internet for ways to force the driver/os to accept me, the way my father never did,
I managed to get it working, using various bits of information I found in various places.  

As a word of caution, what I'm about to discus here is not supported and not for the faint of heart,
and you probably should only attempt this as a last ditch effort.  

First, let's try to find the device id, so we know what driver we'll need:

```Powershell
> Get-WMIObject win32_PNPEntity | where {$_.Name -match "Ethernet"} | ft Name, DeviceId

Name                                             DeviceId
----                                             --------
Ethernet Controller                              PCI\VEN_8086&DEV_15B8&SUBSYS_E0001458&REV_31\3&11583659&0&FE
Killer E2200 Gigabit Ethernet Controller         PCI\VEN_1969&DEV_E091&SUBSYS_E0001458&REV_10\FF1EC432408D5CFF00
```

The important part here, is the `VEN_8086&DEV_15B8` between `PCI\` and `&SYBSYS`.  
Next I download the [Intel® Network Adapter Driver for Windows® 10](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/25016/Intel-Network-Adapter-Driver-for-Windows-10)
and unpacked it using 7zip. (any program that can unpack `rar` should be fine though.)  

Next I looked for occurrences of my device string in the driver package:

```Powershell
> Get-ChildItem -Recurse | Select-String -Pattern "VEN_8086&DEV_15B8" | group Path | ft Name

Name
----
PROWinx64\PRO1000\Winx64\NDIS63\e1d63x64.inf
PROWinx64\PRO1000\Winx64\NDIS64\e1d64x64.inf
PROWinx64\PRO1000\Winx64\NDIS65\e1d65x64.inf
PROWinx64\PRO1000\Winx64\NDIS68\e1d68x64.inf
```

It showed up a couple of times.  
To know which one we need, we simply need to know what these `NDIS` numbers are.  
Turns out they are [Network Driver Interface Specifications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/network/overview-of-ndis-versions).  

As I'm on Windows Server 2019, which is the equivalent of Windows 10, I'll need `NDIS68`.  
So I open up `PROWinx64\PRO1000\Winx64\NDIS68\e1d68x64.inf` and look for all occurrences of `VEN_8086&DEV_15B8` in the file.  
For me it showed up twice, in two different sections. So four times total.  
The lines looked like this:

```txt
%E15B8NC.DeviceDesc%            = E15B8.10.0.1,       PCI\VEN_8086&DEV_15B8
%E15B8NC.DeviceDesc%            = E15B8.10.0.1,       PCI\VEN_8086&DEV_15B8&SUBSYS_00008086
```

and like this:

```txt
%E15B8NC.DeviceDesc%            = E15B8.10.0.1.19H1,       PCI\VEN_8086&DEV_15B8
%E15B8NC.DeviceDesc%            = E15B8.10.0.1.19H1,       PCI\VEN_8086&DEV_15B8&SUBSYS_00008086
```

But your milage may vary.  

Having my device specifications in the inf file, I add these 4 lines to each section they were missing from and saved the changes.  
Then I copied the whole `PRO1000` directory to the target machine.  

Next, ont hat machine we turn the safeties off so we can ignore the fact that our driver signature is incorrect
and that we're not supposed/allowed to install it.  

Step 1: Turn off secure boot.  
Step 2: use `bcedit` to turn of safeties.  

```cmd
bcdedit /set LOADOPTIONS DISABLE_INTEGRITY_CHECKS
bcdedit /set TESTSIGNING ON
bcdedit /set NOINTEGRITYCHECKS ON
```

Some people mentioned you have to restart the server for this to take effect.  
I honestly didn't and it still worked, but YMMV.  

Next, we manually install the driver:

```cmd
pnputil.exe -i -a .\NDIS68\e1d68x64.inf
```

This gives a huge security warning and in the distance a siren started wailing.  

> *Windows can't verify the publisher of this driver.*  
>
> *Install this driver software anyway*.

And we're done here:

```Powershell
> Get-NetAdapter

Name                      InterfaceDescription                    ifIndex Status       MacAddress             LinkSpeed
----                      --------------------                    ------- ------       ----------             ---------
Ethernet 2                Intel(R) Ethernet Connection (2) I219-V       9 Disconnected 40-8D-5C-1E-C4-30          0 bps

```

Success!  

Now, let's quickly turn the safeties back on and act like this all never happened.  
I need a fucking drink...  
And a shower.  

```Powershell
bcdedit /set LOADOPTIONS ENABLE_INTEGRITY_CHECKS
bcdedit /set TESTSIGNING OFF
bcdedit /set NOINTEGRITYCHECKS OFF

Restart-Computer
# Don't forget to turn secure boot back on if you turned it off.
```
